            <p><h2>3.6 Summary</h2></p>
            <p>In this chapter, you have studied te following points:</p>

            <p> <b>1.</b> Two linear equation in the same two variables are called a pair of linear equation in two variables. The most general form of a pair of linear equation</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    a<sub>1</sub>x + b<sub>1</sub>y+ c<sub>1</sub> = 0
                </p>
                <p>
                    a<sub>2</sub>x + b<sub>2</sub>y+ c<sub>2</sub> = 0
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Where a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>are real numbers, such that a<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> + b<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> &#8800 0, a<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> + b<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> &#8800 0.
            </p>

            <p> <b>2.</b> A pair of linear equation in two variable can be represented, and solved, by the: </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>(i) graphical method</p>
                    <p>(ii) algebraic method</p>
                </blockquote>
                    
                    

            <p> <b>3.</b> <b>Graphical Method</b> : 
                <p> The graph of a pair of linear equation in two variable is represented by two lines.</p>
            </p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>(i) If the lines intersect at a point, then that point gives the unique solution of the two
                    equations. In this case, the pair of equations is <strong>consistent</strong>.</p>
                <p>(ii) If the lines coincide, then there are infinitely many solutions â€” each point on the
                line being a solution. In this case, the pair of equations is <strong>dependent (consistent)</strong>.</p>
                <p>(iii) If the lines are parallel, then the pair of equations has no solution. In this case, the
                    pair of equations is <strong>inconsistent</strong>.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                <b>4.</b> <b>Algebraic Methods</b> : We have discussed the following methods for finding the solution(s)
                of a pair of linear equations :
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>(i) Substitution Method</p>
                <p>(ii) Elimination Method</p>
                <p>(iii) Cross-multiplication Method</p>
            </blockquote>

                <p> <b>5.</b> If a pair of linear equations is given by a<sub>1</sub>x + b<sub>1</sub>y + c<sub>1</sub> = 0 and  a<sub>2</sub>x + b<sub>2</sub>y + c<sub>2</sub> = 0, then the following situations can arise :</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p> <small>(i)</small> a1/a2 = b1/b2 : In this case, the pair of linear equations is <strong>consistent</strong></p>
                    <p> <small>(ii)</small> a1/a2 = b1/b2 &#8800 c1/c2 : In this case, the pair of linear equations is <strong>inconsistent</strong></p>
                    <p> <small>(iii)</small> a1/a2 = b1/b2 : In this case, the pair of linear equations is <strong>dependent</strong> and <strong>consistent</strong></p>                    
                </blockquote>
                
                <p> <b>6.</b> There are several situations which can be mathematically represented by two equations that are not linear to start with. But we alter them so that they are reduced to a pair of linear equations.</p>
